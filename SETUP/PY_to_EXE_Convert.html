To convert a Python script to an executable file with a .exe extension, you can use various tools such as PyInstaller, cx_Freeze, Py2exe, or PyOxidizer. 
Here is a simple example of using PyInstaller:

Install PyInstaller using pip:  pip install pyinstaller

Navigate to the directory containing your Python script using the command prompt or terminal.

Run the following command to create the executable file:   "pyinstaller your_script_name.py"

And if you want to take just one file . so type under code
Run the following command to create the executable file:    "pyinstaller --onefile your_script_name.py"

3. Optional ->
if you want to change icon of the exe file:
    "pyinstaller -w -F -i "picture.ico" your_script_name.py"

This command will create a single executable file in the "dist" folder of your current directory. You can then distribute this file to other users without requiring them to install Python or any additional dependencies.

Note that PyInstaller may not work perfectly for all scripts and dependencies.
 You may need to adjust the command line options or 
 modify your code to ensure that it runs correctly as an executable.
